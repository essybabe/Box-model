Time is money.Imagine having to write a letter to my friend, wait like a month for it to arrive, then another month to get a reply! Ugh! Now imagine having to go through all that even if you donâ€™t enjoy reading or writing! And there you are wondering why to love technology! Enough said! Think about it the next time you grab your phone and take time to notice how much easier it is for us now to keep in touch with friends and family, even if they live on a different side of the globe.</i></p>
